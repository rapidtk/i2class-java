# i2class-java
i2class provides Object-Oriented interfaces to IBM i programming constructs; files, data areas, modules, programs, data queues, message files, message descriptions etc. and also handles "mutable" fixed-length data (e.g. CHAR, PACKED, VARCHAR, etc.).  File classes map record-level access to either native (jt400) or SQL-based requests without any need to modify existing code bases.
